            of ATH becomes life or ATH is listed in exchanges, ATH will be of similar volatility and
            subject to the same factors faced by other cryptocurrencies. You also acknowledge that
            the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time
            causing an impact to any activities taking place on the blockchains. You acknowledge

            time informal dispute resolution under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision begins,
            then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims,
            subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or
            relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the
            parties' relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally
            settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in
            accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary
            procedures for consumer related disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the
            "AAA"), excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.

            Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are
            void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be
            empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
            The arbitrator's award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered

            discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

            basis. YOU AND ATHENE NETWORK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN
            YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
            CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class
            action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or
            that arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth
            above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety, and the parties shall be deemed to
